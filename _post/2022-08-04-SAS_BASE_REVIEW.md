# SAS BASE  TEST REVIEW



## How to study

As a student, I took an online class on sas homepage. I heard that the exam gets a lot difficult after it has been changed so I thought I had to take expensive online class for this. However, it was too pricey(550 dollars)... I gave up doing that because I am a poor student.

But the class in SAS was perfect for me. It covers all the details so I recommend just to take this for free!!! As long as you can read English, you won't have a problem to take.



## Cost of the exam

It would cost 150 dollars unless you are a student. In won, it is more expensive.. failing the test is equal to losing a brand new basketball shoes. Luckily, I passed the test at once and I just paid 75 dollars.



## Place of the exam

I went to South Piedmont College In US to take the test. You could take it at home, but I thought it would be a hassle to prepare all by myself. So, I decided to take the test at a test center. It was better than I expected.



## Score of the test

I got 979 out of 999. I have reviewed 2 times so I thought I got 999 out of 999. However, it was lower than my expectation. Well. the important thing is that I passed the test.

## Review

If you take the online class and review thoroughly, you would be able to pass it so easily. SAS is not as intuitive as other programming language such as python, R. But as long as you get used to it, passing the test would be easy. I will post Advanced test review soon.
