# SAS Advanced  test review



## How to study

As I said, I have studied with using the online class on SAS homepage. There were more stuff to study so I got annoyed from forgetting what I learn before when I was learning another stuff. Therefore, I had to review 3 times and solve the examples multiple times.

Personally, the most important thing before an exam is to take a mock test on SAS hompage so that you can have actual experience.



## Cost of the exam

75 dollars like a base exam. it was quite expensive even though it was discounted.



## Place of the exam

I took it at the same place(Piedmon community college). The supervisor recoginized me since I took the test a month before. Follow the instruction from her and entered.

## Pass score

I got 876 out of 876. I have studied SQL and macro sectoins very hard but I got the highest score in Advanced tequnique.. ironi?

## Review

Many people who took this test said it was very difficult and hard to pass at one time. In my opnion, it won't be that complicated if you study thoroughly. Before writing a code, you should take time to think about what the code means first. My adventure of SAS test is over. I think I have to study sgplot by myself for my career.(I wish there was a course for sgplot).
